    <h1>FAQ</h1>
    <h2>Do you need keys to my house?
      </p>
    </h2>
<p>Yes, as well as a duplicate copy for emergencies.  Keys can also be left with a doorman as long as they are on duty during visits.</p>
    <h2>How do I make payments?</h2>
    <p>Walk 'n' Wag  accepts checks, credit card payments, and bank transfers through PayPal.  Check payments can made to Walk 'n' Wag Inc. Payments can be made at the beginning or end of the week for any services rendered.  We do not accept cash but you may tip your walker in cash or leave a note in the memo of your check or attached to your online payment.  Statements can be generated online for any period of walk and payment history.</p>
<h2>What are the benefits of dog walking over daycare?</h2>
<p>For many dogs daycare environments can reinforce undesirable behavior and may cause anxiety from the ever changing group of other dogs.  Many common dog illnesses can also be contracted in the daycare settings, making it unsafe for puppies and some older dogs.  A dog walker provides personal and specialized attention for you and your pet.  As your personal pet professional we can help tackle any issue you may have and help your dog be the best they can be! </p>
    <h2>Do you walk aggressive dogs?</h2>
    <p>We do not discriminate against any animal. We would be happy to help and work through any issues you are having with your pet.  By being a calm assertive leader we can gain your dogs respect and can help limit undesirable outbursts by controlling your dogs surroundings and rewarding calm behavior.<br />
    </p>
    <h2>Are there a minimum number of walks required per week?</h2>
    <p>Yes. We do not provide part time service for dog clients. We require two scheduled walks per week for you to be eligible for &quot;on call&quot; and vacation care service (dogs only).  We do offer part time service and vacation care for our cat and small animal clients but request more flexibility for visit times.</p>
    <h2>Do you offer services for pets other than dogs and cats?</h2>
    <p>Yes, we would be happy to help with any household pet, not just cats! Rates for other pets are the same as those for cats, visits are 25 minutes.</p>
    <h2>Can you administer medication?</h2>
    <p>Yes. We would be happy to administer any medication during the walk visit. A walk through from the owner may be needed in some cases.</p>
    <h2>What is House Sitting?</h2>
    <p>House Sitting Services are offered for our dog clients. Your walker will stay in your home and basically “fill in” for you in your absence. Your dog will receive three 25 minute walks as well as a short “relief walk” anytime your walker leaves for another appointment or errand. An overnight stay, mail pickup, and plant watering are included.</p>
    <h2>What is a “regular schedule”?</h2>
    <p>The regular schedule will be discussed at the initial interview. This weekly schedule will go in automatically every week unless we hear differently from you. If your schedule changes frequently, you can email us weekly or monthly with your schedule instead.</p>
    <h2>What is your cancellation policy?</h2>
    <p>As long as your cancellation request is received and confirmed before the walker is on their way to the visit then you will not be charged. </p>
    <h2>How do I schedule walks?</h2>
    <p>You can schedule walks by phone, email, and even text message. When adding a walk by text, email, or voicemail you will always receive a confirmation.  </p>
    <h2>Do you work on weekends or holidays?</h2>
    <p>Yes. Walk 'n' Wag works everyday of the year and has rates for any hour of the day.</p>
    <h2>What is licensed, insured, and bonded?  </h2>
    <p>Walk 'n' Wag Inc. is Licensed through their incorporation in Illinois to provide pet care service and holds a Chicago business license as well.  We are Insured and Bonded through _____________ to protect the health of your pet and the safety and security of your home.</p>
    <h2>What does the insurance cover?</h2>
    <p>Insurance covers any personal property in our care, custody, and control (including pets) up to $100,000. All other claims are insured up to $1,000,000 with a $2,000,000 aggregate.</p>
    <h2>Are your employees background checked?</h2>
    <p>Yes, applicants are screened for any felony criminal record or any crimes against people or property. Walkers are also spot checked by managers on a consistent basis to ensure quality walks and accurate visit times for our clients.</p>
